# Frontend Mentor - Space tourism website

![Design preview for the Space tourism website coding challenge](/public/preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. Our challenges are perfect portfolio pieces, so please feel free to use what you create in your portfolio to show others.

**To do this challenge, you need a strong understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this multi-page space tourism website and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

**This project is a collaboration between us, Scrimba, and Kevin Powell. If you'd like to see how Kevin would tackle the project, you can [follow along on Scrimba's free course](https://scrimba.com/learn/spacetravel).**

If you're working through it yourself, please use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

If you choose to use a JS-heavy approach, we provide a local `data.json` file for the different page data. This means you'll be able to pull the data from there instead of using the separate `.html` files.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information
